            <p>The student life at UA Little Rock is typical of public universities in the United States. 
              It is characterized by student-run organizations and affiliation groups that support social, academic, athletic, and religious activities and interests. 
              Some of the services offered by the UA Little Rock Office of Campus Life are intramural sports and fitness programs, diversity programs, leadership development, 
              peer tutoring, student government association, student support programs including groups for non-traditional and first-generation students, a student-run newspaper, 
              and fraternity and sorority life. The proximity of the UA Little Rock campus to downtown Little Rock enables students to take advantage of a wide array of recreational, 
              entertainment, educational, internship, and employment opportunities that are not available anywhere else in Arkansas.[20]</p>

              The university has four residence halls on the eastern side of the campus and the University Village Apartment Complex[21] on the southern side of campus. 
              Six learning communities focusing on criminal justice, arts and culture, majors and careers, future business innovators, nursing careers, 
              and STEM are available to students</p>
