        <h3>Pacifica: A Word Of Warning</h3>
        <p>Warning: The Pacifica Distirct is NOT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE NCPD, and entering the Pacifica District in Night City is not without risks.
          This area, once a luxurious resort, is now plagued by violence, gangs, and lawlessness.
          The streets are controlled by hostile factions, and the environment is unpredictable. Civilians are scarce, and even the most experienced mercenaries can find themselves
          in danger. If you must venture into Pacifica, be prepared for anything, trust no one, and always watch your back. Stay alert and stay alive.</p>
