    <h3>Night City's History</h3>
    <p>Night City has a storied and intensive history of prowess and victory against the forces of war, the NUSA, 
      extremist attacks and more, this short timeline compiles many of the major historical events that made Night City 
      what is is today.
    </p>
    <div class="timeline">
      <p> <strong> Night City Founded 1990-1994</strong> Richard Night, 
        with the funds of interested corpos, conceptualized and built Night City as a 
        free economic zone, its once-to-be name "Coranado City" was changed to Night City 
        following the assasination of Richard Night before the city's completion.</p>
    <p> <strong> The Corpo Wars 2005-2020</strong> &nbsp; The three 
      infamous Corporate or "Corpo" wars defined much of Night City's early years, 
      from land desputes between the mob and corpos, many of the Corpo Wars most important 
      players found their HQ's in Night City. Despite all of the turmoil surrounding each conflict,
      Night City has always perserviered.</p>
      <p> <strong>Arasaka Tower Bombing 2021</strong> The infamous 
        bombing of Night City's crown jewel, Arasaka Tower has gone down in history 
        as NC's most extreme case of domestic terrorism. Perpetrated by muscian and activist 
        Johnny Silverhand, the famous and proud Arasaka Tower, alongside much of the Corpo Plaza was 
        decimated by a micro-nuke carried by the now infamous rockerboy.</p>
    <p> <strong>Fourth Corpo War 2021-2023</strong> Following the 
      severe attack on Arasaka Tower, multiple corporations would band together 
      in an attempt to strike down Arasaka in the last Corporate War to date, known simply as the 
      Fourth Corpo War, its impact on Night City is still felt even after the rebuild projects, with 
      the war leaving Arasaka as a major investor in Night City and creating a rise in crime following the destruction of much of the city.</p>
    <p> <strong> Reconstruction 2025-2060 </strong> &nbsp; With much of 
      Night City left in rubble, the Corporations of the world sought to rebuild 
      Night City stronger and more prosperous than ever. There where many challenges faced during 
      this decades long period of reconstruction, such as gang violence, corporate disputes and much 
      more but following the citys rebuild Night </p>
      <p> <strong> Unification War 2069-2070 </strong> Hungry for power and 
        influence, the NUSA under new president Rosiland Myers sought to once again reunify the 
        fractured country of America under one nation. The NUSA's campaign eventually entered Night City,
         with open warfare breaking out in the newly devoping areas of Night City. Night City would once again 
         emerge the victor, fully becoming and autonmous econmic and political zone. The scars of the war are 
         still seen in the lawless zones of Pacifica and Barghest controlled Dogtown.</p>
      <p>
        <strong> NC Today 2077-Present </strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; Today Night City is a city rivaled by almost none, housing many of the worlds most influencial peoples and corporations, a city of true personal freedom and cultural diversity. While still plauged with the gang violence that many major cities face, Night City is a shining beacon of hope in a world divided in turmoil.
